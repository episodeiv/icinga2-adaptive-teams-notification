# icinga2-teams-notification

This is a adaptive version of:
- [REPO](https://github.com/seffparker/icinga2-teams-notification)
Which is based on:
- [slack alert](https://github.com/seffparker/icinga2-rich-slack-notification)

This is trying to get back to be more in line with the slack alerts.

# Limitation / ToDo
Code in markdown seems to be unsupported?
